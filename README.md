# SCMvL: A Search-based Contrastive Multi-View Learning for Graph Classification.
The original implementation for paper SCMvL: A Search-based Contrastive Multi-View Learning for Graph Classification.

SCMvL approach systematically composes multi-view from a sample graph engaging a pre-trained framework using contrastive learning in GNN and achieves state-of-the-art on 7 out of 10 datasets for graph classification task.
